# scURL Shorterer
This is a very (very very) simple build of a URL Shorterer.

The solution contain simple a public area for insert/create a new URL and a private area for insert/update/delete new and existing URL.

The project use a thirt party dlls locate in BIN folder. 
In particular the SCFramework (Samuele Carassai Framework) its my framework builded for help me in the building of web-site.
In this case i used only almost exclusively for interface the application with the DataBase.

The application is responsive and i used Boostrap for manage layout.
Its a very small application but i tried to make a good structure to thinking for a future implementation.

# Behavior
Insert the long URL in place and press create button.
ENJOY!

# Installation
The web application wrote with VS2013.
So need to install all file, open project solution, build and play.
Remember to assign to folders "public" and "mdb-database" the read/write/cretion permissions.

# Administration
- user: admin
- psw: nimda
